# Kutlas
---
Kutlas is a brand new programming language based on Kotlin, that is directed to be programmed for operating systems, rather than for the browser and Andriod. Kutlas is object oriented, and programmed in Java, so it will be able to be used on any platform, whether Windows, Mac, or Linux. The main objective for Kutlas, is to be the first programming language to be made more specifically for games, rather than regular programs, although can still be used to make programs.
