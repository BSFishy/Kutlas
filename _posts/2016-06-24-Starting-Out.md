## Hello!
---
Hello! I am mttprvst13, the founder, and current coder of Kutlas. I want to tell you a little bit about Kutlas, and my objectives with it.

## What is Kutlas?
---
Kutlas is a brand new programming language based on Kotlin, that is directed to be programmed for operating systems, rather than for the browser and Andriod. Kutlas is object oriented, and programmed in Java, so it will be able to be used on any platform, whether Windows, Mac, or Linux. The main objective for Kutlas, is to be the first programming language to be made more specifically for games, rather than regular programs, although can still be used to make programs. The basic funtionalities such as "if" statements, "while" statements, and so forth will be in the base package, but a side package that contains everything necessary to make a game will also be installed.

## What are the different "objectives" for Kutlas?
---
I have 4 main objectives for Kutlas. Make it handle well with games, and window applications. I also want to make it a Minecraft Forge modification, and a Bukkit Minecraft server plugin.

### Games
---
I want Kutlas to have a game library built into it. The programmer would be able to make their own games, and similar applications, without even having to install a 3rd party library. The Java library to be used is going to be [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/), because I have a good understanding and knowledge with it, plus I belive it is the superior game development library.

### Windowed applications
---
I want Kutlas to have equal ability to make a game, as well as a windowed application. The code is going to be easy, although similar to Java code, using the JavaFX package. It will have every, or almost every feature built into the windowed application package.

### Minecraft Forge Modification
---
I want Kutlas to eventually have a Minecraft Forge modification, to allow a developer, or modpack creator to easilly program their own blocks, items, biomes, or whatever they may want. This would be an all in one package. The single modification would have the latest programming language built into it, plus the necessary functionality to allow for the user to make items, blocks, biomes, and so forth.

### Bukkit Server Plugin
---
I want Kutlas to also have a Bukkit server plugin. If I had to compare this best to an existing Bukkit plugin, I would say it would be most like [Skript](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/skript/). The developer will be able to program their own events, commands, and whatever else they may want to program. The same as the Minecraft Forge Modification, this will be an all in one package, with the latest programming language, and necessary functionality to allow for the user to create anything they may want to.

## Want to help?

So far, I am the only one working on this project, and it is only still in it's alpha stage. What I have just finished is the base-lines to the program launcher. I still need to program the language itself. The language file will be it's own seperate file, from the launcher file, to allow multiple versions to be used at the same time. Right now, I am programming some examples on how I want Kutlas to look, and am going to start on the development of the language itself, after that. If you can program Java, and are interested, give me an email at [lousylynx12@gmail.com](mailto:lousylynx12@gmail.com).
